## Documentation Proposal
- **Develop a Jupyter Notebook Tutorial:** Create a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook tutorial showcasing wastewater monitoring using V-pipe.
- **Experiment with V-pipe setup:** Test V-pipe installation on different environments and operating systems to identify potential setup issues and document troubleshooting steps.
- **Compile Bioinformatic Resources:** Develop a section within the documentation defining common bioinformatics terms relevant to V-pipe and wastewater analysis.
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** Identify common errors encountered during V-pipe setup and create a dedicated section or resource within the documentation to guide users through solutions.
- **Config.html Integration:** Explore integrating the information from config.html into the Read the Docs platform, ensuring users have easy access to and understanding of configuration options.
